# LAB - Class 42

## Project: Pythonisms

## Author: Bradley Hower

## Overview

In this session, some "pythonic" code will be used which utilitzes the language features of Python. It includes giving a class iteration ability, a decorator and dunder methods.

## Getting Started

Can me ran withh `python3 pythonisms.py`.

Within the code, below the class:

`numbers = Powers(3)`

Sets the max.

`i = iter(numbers)`

Creates iterables according to max.

```
print(next(i))
print(next(i))
```

Prints the next iteration, each time.

## Tests

Working on it.
